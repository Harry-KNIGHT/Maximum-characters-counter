# Typing Progress Circle

Have you ever wondered how to create a typing progress indicator similar to the ring on Twitter? This repository explores a method to achieve this effect using SwiftUI's Gauge, inspired by insights gained from the [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com) and their coverage on [Gauge in SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/gauge).

Initially, I attempted to create a custom circle by experimenting with code found in various Medium articles. However, I encountered challenges while adapting the code to suit my requirements. This led me to explore Apple's Gauge functionality in SwiftUI, which turned out to be a perfect fit for the task.

The simplicity and elegance of SwiftUI's Gauge made the process a delight. I found that it condensed the required code to just a few lines, simplifying the implementation significantly. Many thanks to Apple for providing such intuitive tools!
